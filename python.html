    <h1>Python Experience</h1>

    <p id="para">My experience with Python began with my first class at ASU, IFT 101 Info Tech Programming Logic. In
        this course
        I learned basic analysis and synthesis procedures for an understanding of information systems logical
        structures.
        All coding that was presented in this class was in Python. Prior to this class, I had no coding experience. It
        was
        an amazing revelation to realize that I would no longer be contrained by the parameters of the software that was
        commercially available but would be able to create my own programs to accomplish the task at hand. This created
        a
        passion for learning in me that has driven me to not only succeed in my studies but to incorporate what I learn
        into
        my daily live and grow through the process.
