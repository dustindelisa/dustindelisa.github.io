            <p>
                I have supported the Quality organization for 8 of my 14 years of Manufacturing experience.
                3 years as an NDT Level III lead and 3 years as a Quality Engineer. I have the skills and
                experience to drive continual improvement of Quality Management Systems (QMS) including
                principles of auditing, planning, execution, and follow up. In my training and experience
                with AS9100, I know a System Audit can be conducted either on the entire QMS or through audits
                of individual QMS elements. Process reviews also may be conducted in accordance with the process
                review instruction on various processes within the QMS and may be considered as an accomplishment
                of the requirement to audit that portion of the QMS. My technical background gives me a competitive
                edge in understanding the nuances of NDT (Non-destructive Testing) and Special Processes.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            As a Quality Engineer, I have used leading and lagging indicators such as PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act),
            Six Sigma, and process controls to develop focused efforts that have produced quality improvements
            which met or exceeded data driven and financial goals.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            In Corrective Action / Mistake Proofing (CAMP) I have effectively used problem solving tools to identify
            root cause, direct cause, and contributing causes. This is extremely beneficial in root cause analysis
            and risk assessment. Constructing a cause chain gives a great visual of the noncompliance and helps
            identify systemic noncompliance and implement the most robust corrective actions.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            I have led and participated in various cross-functional teams which included suppliers and customers. Among
            these teams were specific initiative deployment and management, root-cause corrective-action, and
            presentation
            of quality metrics and technical data to customers.
            </p>

                I am now learning Information Technology with ASU Fulton School of Engineering. Some of the technical
                skills
                that I have learned include Python, Java, and HTML. Click the links below to see some examples.
